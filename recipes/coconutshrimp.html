    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These coconut shrimp are rolled in a coconut beer batter before frying. Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce â€” I use orange marmalade, mustard, and horseradish mixed to taste for a dipping sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>3/4 Cup all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>2/3 Cup Beer</li>
        <li>1 Large Egg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
        <li>2 Cups Flaked Coconut</li>
        <li>24 Medium Raw Shrimp, shelled, deveined, with tails attached</li>
        <li>3 Cups Oil for frying</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with wax paper; set aside. </li>
            <li>Whisk together 1/2 cup flour, beer, egg, and baking powder in a medium bowl until smooth. Place coconut and remaining 1/4 cup flour in 2 separate bowls. </li>
            <li>One at a time, hold shrimp by the tail and dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in beer batter; allow excess to drip off. Roll in coconut, then place on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry shrimp in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Use tongs to remove shrimp to paper towels to drain. </li>
        </ol>
